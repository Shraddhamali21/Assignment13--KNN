1. GLASS DATASET

In this data science project, I undertook the task of building a classification model for glass classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Leveraging the KNN algorithm's ability to classify data points based on their similarity to neighboring points, I aimed to develop a robust model for accurately predicting the type of glass based on its chemical composition. Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The primary objective of the project was to develop a classification model using the KNN algorithm to predict the type of glass based on its chemical composition attributes. The dataset, named "glass.csv," contained various features such as refractive index, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, barium, and iron content, along with the corresponding type of glass. The goal was to train the KNN model on the provided data and evaluate its performance in accurately classifying the type of glass.
 
Approach:
 
The project followed a structured approach to model development and evaluation, encompassing the following key steps:
 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
 - Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the features.
 - Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, if any, and scale or normalize the numerical features to ensure consistency.
 
2. Model Training using KNN:
 - Implementing the KNN algorithm to build a classification model for glass classification.
 - Configuring the number of neighbors (K) and other hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
 
3. Model Evaluation:
 - Assessing the performance of the KNN model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
 - Utilizing techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization of the model's performance.
 
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):
 - Conducting hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance by selecting the optimal number of neighbors (K) and other relevant parameters.
 - Exploring different parameter combinations to improve the model's predictive accuracy.
 
5. Deployment and Integration:
 - Integrating the trained KNN model into a user-friendly interface or application for making real-time glass type predictions.
 - Deploying the model to production environments for practical usage and decision support.
 
By leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, the project aimed to provide accurate predictions of glass types based on their chemical composition attributes. The project not only enhanced my skills in classification modeling using KNN but also underscored the importance of machine learning techniques in materials science and industry applications such as glass manufacturing and quality control.


2. ZOO DATASET

In this data science project, I tackled the task of implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to classify animals into categories based on their attributes. Leveraging the simplicity and effectiveness of the KNN algorithm in classification tasks, I aimed to develop a reliable model for accurately predicting the categories to which animals belong. The dataset used for this project is named "Zoo.csv," containing various features describing the characteristics of different animals. Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The primary goal of the project was to implement a KNN classification model to categorize animals into distinct groups based on their attributes. The dataset "Zoo.csv" comprised features such as the presence or absence of specific characteristics, including hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne capability, aquatic life, predator status, and more. The objective was to train the KNN model on the provided dataset and evaluate its performance in accurately classifying animals into predefined categories.
